			Successful reboot is the code for company's growth</h3>

		<p style="color: white">
			NEW DELHI: The initial public offer of homegrown product-technology
			company Newgen Software Technologies was subscribed eight times on
			the third and final day of its public market debut, in the process,
			providing its three risk capital backers with stellar exits.

	<p id="sf">The successful IPO is bound to bring great cheer to the
		country's often beleaguered venture capital industry, given their
		overall paucity in India. Both, IDG Ventures India and Ascent Capital,
		who held about 17% of Newgen stock, are expected to cumulatively earn
		more than Rs 280 crore, on the back of their five-year-old Rs
		108-crore bet on the company. "It's been a phenomenal achievement,
		given that they are based in India, and have most of their R&D here.
		Inspite of that,they have been able to keep up with the best across
		the world," Sunil Kolangara, partner at Ascent Capital, told ET.The
		IPO is the culmination of a 25-year-old journey by founders Diwakar
		Nigam and TS Varadarajan in 1992, who first met during their student
		days in IIT Madras in the mid-70s, and then got together a few years
		later to set up Newgen Software. However, a public market debut could
		have taken place almost a decade ago, but those plans were forced to
		be put on hold after the 2008 financial crisis brought global markets
		to their knees.</p>
	<h3 style="color: purple">India ranks 2nd in app downloads</h3>
	<img src="images/1.jpg" width="90" height="80">
	<p style="color: white">
		BENGALURU: India has clocked the second-largest number of mobile app
		downloads, overtaking the US and trailing only China, according to a
		report from App Annie â€” a third-party agency which collates data on
		apps.
		<button id="b1">Read More</button>
	</p>
	<p id="sf1">This data is inclusive of Apple's iOS Store, Google
		Play and third-party Android stores. App usage grew rapidly in India,
		driven by the introduction of subsidised, unlimited 4G access by
		Reliance Jio in September 2016, the report noted. India saw a growth
		of about 215% while US saw a degrowth of 5% during 2017. India, which
		is seen as an emerging market in the app economy, came on top of the
		list for highest monthly average number of apps used and installed. On
		an average, Indians use more than 40 apps in a month, while having a
		total base of close to 80 apps. On this parameter, China and Brazil
		are behind India. Incidentally, the report threw light on consumer
		spending behaviour of Indians with regards to mobile apps. Despite the
		popular perception that Indians shy away from paying for in-app
		purchases, dating app Tinder and over-the-top (OTT) entertainment
		platform Netflix topped the chart as far as spends on apps go.</p>
	<h3 style="color: #008B8B">New techniques boost performance of
		non-volatile memory systems</h3>
	<img src="images/technologies.jpeg" width="90" height="80">
	<p style="color: white">
		Computer engineering researchers at North Carolina State University
		have developed new software and hardware designs that should limit
		programming errors and improve system performance in devices that use
		non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies.
		<button id="b2">Read More</button>
	</p>
	<p id="sf2">"Currently, computers rely on dynamic random access
		memory (DRAM) for their operations," says James Tuck, an associate
		professor of electrical and computer engineering at NC State and
		co-author of two papers on the work. "But DRAM has significant
		limitations, making it difficult to scale up to deal with next
		generation systems. "As a result, next generation computer systems
		will likely rely on emerging NVM technologies for both operations and
		data storage. Our work here is focused on addressing some of the
		programming and performance challenges inherent in shifting from a
		DRAM computing paradigm to NVM," says Yan Solihin, a professor of
		electrical and computer engineering at NC State and co-author of the
		papers. One challenge with NVM systems is determining how to log, or
		save, a chunk of memory before making changes to it. These logs allow
		users to reset memory if the system fails, corrupting the memory that
		is being modified. At present, logging in an NVM system would require
		programmers to incorporate additional code into their programs --
		slowing performance -- and increasing the number of operations that
		write over memory. Memory reliability suffers if it is written over
		too often. To address this, researchers have developed a system called
		Proteus, which includes a software model and complementary hardware.

		Because NVM computers are at present largely theoretical, the
		researchers compared the performance of Proteus against other
		techniques in a detailed simulator. Other techniques wrote to memory
		two to six times more than Proteus, meaning Proteus was much better at
		preserving the long-term reliability of memory. "Compared to existing
		techniques, Proteus was able to log memory almost for free, in terms
		of writing to memory," Solihin says. Proteus also performed better
		than other techniques in terms of run speed, though the advantage
		there was more modest -- a 9 percent to 11 percent improvement over
		the best existing techniques.</p>
	<h3 style="color: #FF69B4">AT&T wants the world to see its
		software for spinning up services</h3>
	<img src="images/at&t.jpg" width="90" height="80">
	<p style="color: white">
		In an open letter and a series of full-page ads in major newspapers,
		AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson on Wednesday urged Congress to enact an
		Internet Bill of Rights and to bring the Net neutrality debate to an
		end.
		<button id="b3">Read More</button>
	</p>
	<p id="sf3">Although AT&T supported the Federal Communications
		Commission's December vote to repeal its Net neutrality rules, the
		company has called on legislators to establish new laws to regulate
		the Internet. AT&T wants to make sure there is a transparent and open
		Internet for all consumers, Stephenson maintained. "Legislation would
		not only ensure consumers' rights are protected, but it would provide
		consistent rules of the road for all Internet companies, across all
		websites, content devices and applications," Stephenson wrote in the
		open letter. AT&T objected to regulation under Title II, but it
		supported the Net neutrality rules the FCC established in 2010, which
		did not rely on Title II regulations, noted company spokesperson
		Michael Balmoris. "The purpose of today's open letter calling for an
		Internet Bill of Rights was to begin a dialogue on a comprehensive
		framework for basic consumer protections on the Internet that applies
		to all Internet companies," he noted.</p>
